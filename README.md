# UNITTEST
My first time making a unit test in JavaScript using Mocha Tests.

## What is a unit test?
A unit test is a small piece of code that is run to test the functionality of a larger piece of code.

## getCelcius
getCelcius takes a temperature in Fahrenheit and returns the temperature in Celsius.

## test getCelcius
The test validates that the function returns the correct value.
